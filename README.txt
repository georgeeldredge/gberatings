## Summary

This is a simple example project used to learn basic django/python techniques.  It connects to a legacy project on the same server (GBE College Football Ratings - a PHP based project) and returns a summary of data defined by the user.

**This will likely (and by likely, I mean definitely) be un-usable to anyone else choosing to install on their system as you won't have access to the actual data source.  A planed future revision to the original project may make this data more readily available and thus make this project useful to others**
